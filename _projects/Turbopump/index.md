# Intro
Inspired by the work of another rocketry hobbyist, I started this project to gain more understanding of turbopumps and produce my first prototype.
### Cross Section of the Turbopump

# Impeller Design and Analysis
Targeting a pressure rise of 500 PSI, a flow rate of 30 GPM, and an operation speed of 30,000 RPM, I started to roughly shape the overall dimenions of the impeller to try to acheive my goals. Iteratively drafting my basic dimentions and performing hand calculations for velocity triangles got me a pressure rise of about 501 PSI. 

The resulting impeller from hand calculations shown below:

# Volute Section
Using Bernoulli's equation and the velocities expected at the exit of the impeller and the housing, the calculated pressure delta across the housing is -0.94 PSI. Bringing the total system pressure to just over 500 PSI.

# Testing
Flowrate testing was done by the timing of emptying and refilling a 2 gallon bucket multiple times and averaging the flowrate. A flowrate of 26.5 Gallons per minute was found. Attempts to record pressure rise at the outlet were unseccesful. Nearly 0 pressure rise was found at multiple valve positions and only about 1 PSI of pressure rise occured at the fully closed and 90% closed position.
# Results
Basic fit and low RPM testing using a 3D printed shaft revealed the shaft seal was melting to the PETG. After replacing those seals and using a metal shaft that seals were still deteriorating significantly. This is likely due to the high RPM.
